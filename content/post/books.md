### Romanticized Tech

I call this genre of books "romanticized tech" because of the way tech is
portrayed in them in a very idealistic and whimsical way. It's nice to pick up
one of these if you are feeling very "Black Mirror" to remember why you might
have even started in this field.

- [Soul of a New Machine](https://www.amazon.com/Soul-New-Machine-Tracy-Kidder/dp/0316491977): [Bryan Cantrill](https://twitter.com/bcantrill) recommended this to me and it's amazing. It's about Data General building a new computer and the passion the team building it put into it. I wrote [a post with some thoughts on it](https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/new-golden-age-of-building-with-soul/) and [so did he](http://dtrace.org/blogs/bmc/2019/02/10/reflecting-on-the-soul-of-a-new-machine/).
- [A People’s History of Computing in the United States](https://www.amazon.com/Peoples-History-Computing-United-States-ebook/dp/B07DGJ74FV): This book has a bunch of short stories that chronologically take you through some of the most important moments of computing history. I loved reading this after "Soul of a New Machine" because it really tied in nicely to the references of Data General and DEC.
- [The Big Machine](https://www.amazon.com/big-machine-Robert-Jungk/dp/B0006BUS1Y): I found this book at the infamous Bell's books in Palo Alto. It was all worn like someone had previously loved it a lot and it makes me love it even more. It's about CERN and how it came to be and has the same sort of romanticized view of tech as "Soul of a New Machine" and "A People’s History of Computing in the United States".


### Non-Fiction

- [Spy the Lie: Former CIA Officers Teach You How to Detect Deception](https://www.amazon.com/Spy-Lie-Former-Officers-Deception/dp/1250029627): I have now read this book twice. It is amazing if you want to be able to read when people are lying to you. It's a good read backed by a lot of experience from the CIA. Honestly, after reading it the world will be a much different place.
- [Super Brain](https://www.amazon.com/Super-Brain-Unleashing-Explosive-Well-Being/dp/0307956830): I loved this book. It uses science to describe how the brain processes different emotions and what that does to your overall health. It will leave you with all sorts of good feelings after as well as teaching you quite a bit about misconceptions on how the brain works.
- ["Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!": Adventures of a Curious Character](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393355624/): A witty book taken from short stories the notorious professor used to tell. Awesome read, flows quite quickly and is fun. It's filled with fun little physics and life lessons.
- ["What Do You Care What Other People Think?": Further Adventures of a Curious Character](https://www.amazon.com/What-Care-Other-People-Think/dp/0393355640): More Feynman stories just like the above.
- [Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking](https://www.amazon.com/Quiet-Power-Introverts-World-Talking/dp/0307352153/): This is an awesome book and you should watch her [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/susan_cain_the_power_of_introverts?language=en) as well. It's about the power of introverts and how being an introvert should not be something to be ashamed of but rather proud of.
- [Brief Answers to the Big Questions](https://www.amazon.com/Brief-Answers-Questions-Stephen-Hawking/dp/1984819194): If you have read "A Brief History of Time", you will like this follow up answering some of the larger questions of the universe. 
- [Ego is the Enemy](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591847818/): This book
    is a great reminder in staying modest and humble. Ego so often gets in the
    way of great leadership and success and I greatly enjoyed reading a book
    that focused on self-confidence without ego.
- [The Datacenter As a Computer: Designing Warehouse-scale Machines (Synthesis Lectures on Computer Architecture)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1681734338/): This is a overview of how Google designs their datacenters. Overall, super valuable if you work in the space of high-scale compute. I only wish it disclosed more of the reasoning behind certain technical decisions.
- [A Programmer's Introduction to Mathematics](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1727125452): I was a math major so I have a huge fondness for mathematics. This is a great book about math from the point of view of programming.
- [Switch: How to Change Things When Change Is Hard](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385528752): I got this book as a recommendation from [Lara Hogan](https://twitter.com/lara_hogan). It is a great read if you are trying to change something in a culture that does not embrace change. It really details a great approach for doing so that feels like it could almost be weaponized :).
- [The Manager's Path: A Guide for Tech Leaders Navigating Growth and Change](https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth/dp/1491973897): Every single book list should include [Camille's](https://twitter.com/skamille) book. It is a great read for managers and non-managers and has given me the tools for knowing what is normal and what is not.
